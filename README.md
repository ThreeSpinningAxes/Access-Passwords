# Access-Passwords
Source code for program that copies usernames/passwords onto your clipboard from a text file. Useful if you use multiple accounts frequently. Different hotkeys are used to copy different usernames and passwords.

Need textfile called LAccounts.txt in same directory as program. In textfile, to store a username password pair, first type user:"your personal username" and on the next line,
password:"your password for above username". Each account pair is seperated by a newline. To copy a username to clipboard, press ctrl+alt+n, where n is the nth non-empty line. To copy its associative password, press ctrl+alt+(n+1).
